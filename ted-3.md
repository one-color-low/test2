- my first love with the night sky
- loves conpricated

- you looking for of the Happle telescope all teritory field
- we wanna the most decent image og the universe ever observed
- everything you hear as a galaxy comprise of billion stars each
- on the Fibo galaxy, Trurian x2 colam ways

- as a astronaut physicist studying I have been authon privested
just studying
- dolop my carear, superactive and hypermatic black holes
- when went to billion times, arrows massive arron of the sun
- these gratic black holes are diverding materias
- at the rate of approximately thousound times more in average supermassive black holes

- these takes it charactristic what you others these makes quraters
- at the same time, the abject I study, atpppppp powerful streems everobserved
- these near austrain called jet
-  moving in 1909  1909 percent of the speed of light.
- and pointing directory at the earth

- these objected, earth pointed hyperactive, and supermass blackhole is called blazars
- or blazing quasars
- the way of make quasars is special
- the most efficiant part of the exbaters.
- trasforming a aaative energy through out galacy

- here I'm showing the conceptional of blazars.
- the dinner play onto the black holes is called requation desk shown here blue
- some of the materias playing the black holes seen same high speed jet shown here white
- all of the brain sisters far system related
- the process of raaaa desk,

- we are eventualy zoom out the brazer system as assistance
- to show the approximately relationship to the large gractic contact

- the on the accountings of what goes in, what goes out was a hot topics like a physics
- is where the highest jet energy comes from
- in this image interested this white black boards
- and if as a result their any relationship and the criation

- clear answer to this question is almost completely accessable 2008
- NASA telescope better gamarate light
- that is like lite energy, a million times higher than standard accerate scan
- I sigh tiny commettable everation better in data
- and visiable data day a day, and year the year to batter localize geafdsalfjds
- my resarch shows some insenses these sef much clozer to the black holes

- as my reconcil to the localize forming we can better understood accetrating
- and dynamic of the process by which some of the fastnating object in university

- this all started as a love story
- and it still is this love transform me curious, stargazing younger  to the professional
astronaut physician.
- who knew the chasing activety learn so deeply to man
- then again, went to ever know, we loves ful sweater, watch you take us
